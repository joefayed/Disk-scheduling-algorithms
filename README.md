# Disk-scheduling-algorithms
This is a Disk Scheduling Algorithm Demonstration using C#
### Algorithms:
*FCFS <br />
*SSTF <br />
*SCAN <br />
*C-SCAN <br />
*LOOK <br />
*C-LOOK <br />
### Input
1- Number of Cylinders in the Disk <br />
2- Start Cylinder <br />
3- Current Head Position <br />
4- Previous Request <br />
5- Number of Requests <br />
6- The Requests _**Separated By Commas**_ <br />
7- Choose the Algorithm needed <br />
8- Comparison Mode (Used When you need to compare more than one Algorithm) <br />
